# AI Ethics & Innovation: Data Analysis, Models, and Datasets

## Overview

This repository contains all the scripts, models, and datasets used in the research project titled **"The Balance Between AI Ethics & Innovation"**. The primary objective of this project is to explore the relationship between AI ethics and innovation within the public sector, providing a framework to understand and address the concerns of employees and consumers while fostering ethical AI adoption.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`/01-data/`**: Contains the datasets used for analysis. The data has been preprocessed and segmented to align with the research objectives.
- **`/02-Charts/`**: 
- **`/03-notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks that provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the analyses conducted.
- **`/04-summary/`**: Output files such as regression analysis results, figures, and tables used in the final report.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the models, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dandata0101/mbs-structural-equation-modeling
   cd mbs-structural-equation-modeling
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```


3. **Exploring the Notebooks**:
   - Open any notebook in the `/03-notebook/` directory using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to see the detailed analysis.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook model.ipynb
     ```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this study are located in the `/01-data/` directory. Each dataset is accompanied by a README file that provides details on the data sources, preprocessing steps, and any transformations applied. These datasets are anonymized and comply with ethical guidelines for data usage.
